String-calculator
=================

Simple example exercise for colleague. Take a string of mathematical operations, return evaluated numeric!

### Challenge
There are some simple unit tests inside the `calculator_test.py` file, extract some requirements from it and write some software to pass the test

### Example solution
I put together a quick flawed solution that doesn't use the usual CS "Push value, then operator, then value" method and instead relies on creating operator value pairs that can be executed. This is meant to demonstrate there's a lot of viable paths to any particular goal, even with python's ideal 

> There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.

and there's no shame in refactoring later when you know more!
